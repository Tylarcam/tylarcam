## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
âš¡ I'm Tylar Campbell - A Masters in Data Science graduate at Stanford University

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for Data and Machine Learning Opportunities (Internship and Full Time Both) Starting Summer 2025

I am primarily interested in the areas of AI speech technologies, Machine Learning, and Multimodal interactions.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multimodal interactions that combine different ways of interacting with audio - like using voice commands, touch controls, and visual interfaces together.
